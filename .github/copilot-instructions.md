<!-- Copilot instructions for stanwood.dev Astro site -->
# Copilot instructions — stanwood.dev

Purpose: help AI coding agents be immediately productive in this repository.

- Project type: small static site built with Astro v5 (see `astro.config.mjs`).
- Pages live in `src/pages/` and are standard `.astro` files that can contain
  inline client-side scripts (see `src/pages/idea-shuffler.astro`).

Key files & commands
- `package.json`: start here — scripts: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run preview`.
- `astro.config.mjs`: uses Vite plugin `@tailwindcss/vite` (Tailwind is applied via `src/styles/global.css`).
- `src/styles/global.css`: imports Tailwind. No `tailwind.config.js` present in repo.

Big picture architecture
- Static site generated by Astro; pages are compiled at build time. Small, interactive UI
  features embed client-side JS in `.astro` pages rather than being separate SPA apps.
- Styling is Tailwind-first. Expect classes on elements and minimal traditional CSS.
- Stateful tools (like Idea Shuffler) use browser `localStorage` for persistence
  (see `LS_KEY = "idea-shuffler:v2"` in `src/pages/idea-shuffler.astro`).

Patterns & conventions to follow
- Prefer editing the `.astro` page for a feature rather than splitting into a component
  unless the change is reusable across pages. Example: `idea-shuffler` keeps all logic
  inline in `src/pages/idea-shuffler.astro` — move with care.
- Keep changes minimal and focused: this is a personal site, not a large app.
- `package.json` sets `type: "module"` — use ES modules in new JS files.

Developer workflows & debugging
- Install deps and run local dev server from repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Build for production: `npm run build` (output goes to `./dist/`). Preview a build with `npm run preview`.
- Client-side debugging: open browser devtools. For `idea-shuffler`, inspect `localStorage` key
  `idea-shuffler:v2` and modify values to test edge cases.

Integration points & external deps
- Tailwind via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Fonts loaded from Google Fonts in `src/pages/index.astro`.
- No server-side APIs or database integrations in this repo.

When editing or adding features
- If extracting shared UI, add a `src/components/` file and import it into pages.
- Update `README.md` for any change that affects developer setup or scripts.
- Preserve small, focused commits; run `npm run dev` and visually verify changes.

- Interactive tool example / localStorage: [src/pages/idea-shuffler.astro](src/pages/idea-shuffler.astro#L1-L520)
- Tailwind import: [src/styles/global.css](src/styles/global.css#L1)
